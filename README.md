First created a main branch <br>
Then added a project file <br>
commit <br>
created a feature1 branch to main using "git checkout -b feature1"<br>
Then modified project file<br>
commit<br>
created other branch to main - feature2<br>
Then modified project file<br>
When I try to merge feature2 into feature1, I got merge conflicts<br>
To resolve conflicts I modified project file and then done commit<br>
The merged branch is feature1<br>
As we merged feature2 into feature1 , we are deleting feature2.
