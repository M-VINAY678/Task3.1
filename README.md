First created a main branch
Then added a project file
commit
created a feature1 branch to main using "git checkout -b feature1"
Then modified project file
commit
created other branch to main - feature2
Then modified project file
When I try to merge feature2 into feature1, I got merge conflicts
To resolve conflicts I modified project file and then done commit
The merged branch is feature1
As we merged feature2 into feature1 , we are deleting feature2.
